Assumptions:

Endpoints are exposed on the basis of data in database.
Suppose user wants to fetch products on the basis of brands(say ALLEN SOLLY) then user needs to hit url as (http://localhost:9999/product-catalog/products/brands?brands=ALLEN SOLLY).
If user is hitting url as http://localhost:9999/product-catalog/products/brands?brands=Allen Solly  .Then user wont get any data back as Allen Solly is not in there in data base.
